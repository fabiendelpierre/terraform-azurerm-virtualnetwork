# Azure Virtual Network module for Terraform

This simple module creates an opinionated Azure Virtual Network using Terraform. It's opinionated because a number of things are hard-coded to suit my own needs. It's intended as a part of a demo/sandbox application stack integrated with Terraform Cloud, and it exists as a module only to showcase Terraform Cloud's module registry feature.
